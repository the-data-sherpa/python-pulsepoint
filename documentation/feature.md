## In Progress ðŸš§

- [ ] **Enhanced metrics collection**
  - DoD: Metrics for API latency, error rate, and throughput are collected and exposed via Prometheus.

- [ ] **Improved logging system**
  - DoD: Logging includes structured logs, log levels, and log rotation.

- [ ] **Debug logging capabilities**
  - DoD: Debug logs can be toggled via config and are written to a separate file.

---

## Planned Features ðŸ“‹

- [ ] **Heartbeat monitoring**
  - DoD: System sends a heartbeat signal every 5 minutes; alert if missed.

- [ ] **Dead-man switch for failed runs**
  - DoD: System triggers alert if no successful run in X minutes.

- [ ] **Advanced metrics collection**
  - DoD: Collects additional system and API metrics (CPU, memory, etc).

- [ ] **Alert system for failures**
  - DoD: Sends notification (email/SMS/log) on critical failure.

- [ ] **API timeout handling**
  - DoD: System retries on timeout, logs error, and notifies admin.

- [ ] **Incident pattern analysis**
  - DoD: Detects and reports recurring incident patterns.

- [ ] **Geocoding validation**
  - DoD: Validates and corrects incident geocoding.

- [ ] **Weather data integration**
  - DoD: Enriches incidents with weather data.

- [ ] **Traffic data cross-reference**
  - DoD: Adds traffic context to incidents.

- [ ] **Incident deduplication**
  - DoD: Duplicate incidents are detected and merged before processing.

- [ ] **Historical incident tracking**
  - DoD: Maintains searchable incident history.

- [ ] **Incident severity scoring**
  - DoD: Assigns severity score to each incident.

- [ ] **API call caching**
  - DoD: Reduces redundant API calls via caching.

- [ ] **Rate limiting implementation**
  - DoD: Ensures API usage stays within limits.

- [ ] **Batch processing optimization**
  - DoD: Processes incidents in batches for efficiency.

- [ ] **Connection pooling**
  - DoD: Reuses connections for API calls.

- [ ] **Payload compression**
  - DoD: Compresses data sent to endpoints.

- [ ] **Additional agency support**
  - DoD: Add support for new agencies as needed.

- [ ] **Real-time incident updates**
  - DoD: System processes and forwards incident updates within 1s of receipt.
    - [ ] WebSocket integration
    - [ ] UI update mechanism
    - [ ] Test coverage

- [ ] **Incident heat maps**
  - DoD: Visualizes incident density on a map.

- [ ] **Response time analytics**
  - DoD: Analyzes and reports response times.

- [ ] **Automated incident summarization**
  - DoD: Generates summary for each incident.
