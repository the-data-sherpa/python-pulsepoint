## Current Status

- **For detailed, up-to-date feature tracking, see [`feature.md`](./feature.md).**
- **Summary (as of 2024-06-09):**
    - **Completed:** 6 features (e.g., basic metrics, config management, multi-agency support)
    - **In Progress:** 3 features (e.g., enhanced metrics, improved logging, debug logging)
    - **Planned:** 21 features (see `feature.md` for full list and DoD)
- **Recent accomplishments:**
    - Basic metrics collection and Prometheus endpoint
    - YAML-based configuration management
    - Multi-agency support (Iredell, Mecklenburg)
    - Basic error handling and logging
